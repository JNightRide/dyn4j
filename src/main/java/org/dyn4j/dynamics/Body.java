/**
 * Represents an object in a simulation that reacts as defined by newtonian mechanics.
 * <p>
 * A {@link Body} typically has at least one {@link BodyFixture} attached to it. 
 * the {@link BodyFixture}s represent the shape of the body.  When a body 
 * is first created the body is a shapeless infinite mass body.  Add fixtures to
 * the body using the <code>addFixture</code> methods.
 * <p>
 * Use the {@link #setMass(org.dyn4j.geometry.MassType)} methods to calculate the 
 * mass of the entire {@link Body} given the currently attached
 * {@link BodyFixture}s.  The {@link #setMass(Mass)} method can be used to set
 * the mass directly.  Use the {@link #setMassType(org.dyn4j.geometry.MassType)}
 * method to toggle the mass type between the special types.
 * <p>
 * The coefficient of friction and restitution and the linear and angular damping
 * are all defaulted but can be changed via the accessor and mutator methods.
 * <p>
 * By default {@link Body}s will be flagged as at-rest automatically. This occurs when 
 * their linear or angular velocity is low enough (as determined by the 
 * {@link Settings#getMaximumAtRestLinearVelocity()} and 
 * {@link Settings#getMaximumAtRestAngularVelocity()} methods) and they have been this way
 * for a period of time (as determined by {@link Settings#getMinimumAtRestTime()}).  Applying 
 * any force, torque, or impulse will reset the at-rest state to not at-rest. Adding or removing fixtures,
 * changing the mass or mass type, setting linear/angular damping, and setting gravity scale
 * will also reset the at-rest state to not at-rest.  Changing the transform, rotating, translating,
 * or setting the linear or angular velocities will <b>NOT</b> reset the at-rest state. 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Body} becomes disabled when the {@link Body} has left the boundary of
 * the world.
 * <p>
 * A {@link Body} is dynamic if either its inertia or mass is greater than zero.
 * A {@link Body} is static if both its inertia and mass are close to zero.
 * <p>
 * A {@link Body} flagged as a bullet {@link #setBullet(boolean)} will be checked for 
 * tunneling depending on the CCD setting in the world's {@link Settings}.  Use this if the body 
 * is a fast moving body, but be careful as this will incur a performance hit.
